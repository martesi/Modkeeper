### Codebase Overview
- **Language**: Rust (primary), TypeScript (frontend)
- **Build**: Cargo for Rust
- **Frontend**: Bun
- **Project**: Game mod management and development

### Development Guidelines
- **Testing**: Add tests for new features, refactor existing tests after changes
- **Code Duplication**: Check for existing logic before adding new code, prefer extraction
- **Tooling**: Use `cargo run --bin export_types` to update frontend bindings

### Frontend Specifics
- Bun is used as the package manager and dev runtime
- Use Bun commands (e.g., `bun run dev`) for frontend development
- `export_types` binary updates TypeScript bindings

<!-- Problem Decomposition Specification -->
Identify the underlying core critical question that remains unstated, and articulate it clearly.
When decomposing problems, prioritize clarifying causal mechanisms instead of building excessive hierarchical structures. Do not stack empty abstract layers merely to feign profound analysis.
