/*
 * Frozen type surface for the redesign (consolidated-spec.md §9).
 *
 * The UI and repositories type against THIS module, never `@gen/bindings` directly, so the redesign
 * has one stable vocabulary even as the generated bindings churn. The generated shapes already match
 * §9 (camelCase via tauri-specta), so we re-export them here rather than redefine — a single source,
 * no drift. Names/ids are the spec's; the mapping to generated names lives only in this file.
